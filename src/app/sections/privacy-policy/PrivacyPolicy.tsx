          <strong><h2>SECURITY</h2></strong>
          <p>
          Caridi Concierge Medicine PLLC takes appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative steps 
          to maintain the security and accuracy of PII it collects, including limiting the number of people

          <br />
          Despite Caridi Concierge Medicine PLLC’s best efforts, the transmission of data over the Internet

          not secure, it may and can be intercepted by unknown third parties; e-mail content can be changed 
          without the knowledge of the sender or receiver; backup copies of e-mail may still exist even after 
          the sender and receiver have deleted the messages; and e-mail can contain harmful viruses and other 
          programs. While Caridi Concierge Medicine PLLC will use all reasonable means to ensure the security 
          of information You transmit to Caridi Concierge Medicine PLLC cannot guarantee that such information 
          will not be intercepted by third parties, and Caridi Concierge Medicine PLLC will not be liable for the same.
