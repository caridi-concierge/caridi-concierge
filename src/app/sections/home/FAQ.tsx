            <AccordionItem title="What kind of services do you offer?">
              <p>
                I offer restorative treatments that enhance your natural
                features. This includes wrinkle reduction, lip flips, gummy
                smile correction, and crowâ€™s feet using neuromodulators like
                Botox, Xeomin, and Daxxify. For volume and contour, I use dermal
                and biostimulatory fillers, such as RHA, Radiesse, and Juvederm.
                Treatments can be tailored to the lips, face, neck, and even the
                butt.

            <AccordionItem title="Are treatments safe to do at home?">
              <p>
                Yes. Your safety is my top priority. I perform all treatments
                myself, using sterile technique and medical-grade supplies. You
                can expect the same standards you would find in a medical
                office, along with the added comfort and privacy of your own
                space.
