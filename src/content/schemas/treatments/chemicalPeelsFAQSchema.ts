        "@type": "Answer",
        text: "A chemical peel is a controlled exfoliation treatment that uses a blend of medical-grade acids to remove damaged skin cells and stimulate healthy cell turnover. As the outer layers shed, new, smoother skin emerges, helping improve tone, texture, clarity, and overall radiance."

      acceptedAnswer: {
        "@type": "Answer",
        text: "Yes. When the correct formulation is chosen, chemical peels are safe and effective for darker skin tones. Medium-depth blended peels are often preferred because they lift pigment while minimizing the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Check out the VI Peel®, which is great for all skin types."

      acceptedAnswer: {
        "@type": "Answer",

      name: "Can chemical peels be combined with other treatments?",
      acceptedAnswer: {
        "@type": "Answer",
