          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Dermal fillers are injectable gels, most commonly made from hyaluronic acid, that restore lost volume, smooth wrinkles, and enhance facial contours. The hyaluronic acid attracts water and integrates with your tissue, providing natural-looking lift and hydration."

        name: "How long do dermal filler results last?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Results typically last 6 to 12 months, depending on the product used, the treatment area, and how your body metabolizes hyaluronic acid. Areas with more movement, like the lips, may fade sooner, while deeper fillers in the cheeks or chin can last longer."

        name: "What causes lip filler migration?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Lip filler migration occurs when filler moves outside the intended area, often creating puffiness above the lip or blurred borders. It can result from overfilling, improper injection depth, or using filler that is too soft for the area. Following aftercare instructions and choosing an experienced injector helps prevent it."
        }

      {
        "@type": "Question",
        name: "Can migrated filler be corrected?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Yes. If filler has migrated, it can be safely dissolved using an enzyme called hyaluronidase, which breaks down hyaluronic acid-based fillers. Most people see improvement after one or two sessions, and new filler can be placed after about two weeks once the tissue has healed."

        name: "Are dermal fillers safe?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Yes, when performed by a qualified medical professional using FDA-approved products, dermal fillers are very safe. Temporary side effects such as mild swelling, redness, or bruising are common. Serious complications like infection or vascular occlusion are rare but highlight the importance of medical expertise."

        name: "How can I make my filler results last longer?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Maintain results by staying hydrated, avoiding excessive sun or heat exposure, and scheduling maintenance treatments as recommended. Using gentle skincare and avoiding frequent filler top-ups too soon can also help preserve your results and prevent migration."
