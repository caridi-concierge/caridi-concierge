          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Botox temporarily relaxes specific facial muscles that cause expression lines, such as frowning or raising your eyebrows. By reducing this movement, the overlying skin smooths out and fine lines soften, creating a refreshed and natural look."

        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "The average forehead treatment uses 10 to 30 units, depending on muscle strength, skin thickness, and wrinkle depth. Men and patients with more active muscles may need higher doses, while first-time treatments often start conservatively and adjust at follow-up."

          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Most people see results lasting 3 to 4 months, though some experience effects for up to 6 months with consistent treatments. Results typically begin to appear within 5 to 7 days and reach their full effect around two weeks."

        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Side effects are usually mild and temporary, such as slight redness, swelling, or a dull headache. Rare effects include drooping brows or uneven results, which resolve as the product wears off. Botox has an excellent safety record when performed by a trained medical professional."

        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "All are FDA-approved botulinum toxin type A products that smooth wrinkles by relaxing muscles. They differ slightly in onset, spread, and duration-for example, Dysport can take effect faster, while Daxxify often lasts longer, up to six to nine months."

        name: "Can Botox be used for a lip flip?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Yes. A lip flip uses a small amount of Botox above the upper lip to relax the surrounding muscle, causing the lip to gently roll outward. This creates a subtly fuller appearance without adding volume and typically lasts two to three months."
