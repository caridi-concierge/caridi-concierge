          text: "Biostimulatory fillers are injectables that stimulate your body’s natural collagen production rather than simply adding volume. They gradually improve skin thickness, elasticity, and contour for long-lasting rejuvenation."

        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Unlike hyaluronic acid fillers, biostimulatory fillers such as Radiesse and Sculptra use calcium hydroxylapatite or poly-L-lactic acid microspheres to trigger collagen formation. Over time, this new collagen builds a natural support structure beneath the skin."

        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "You may notice subtle improvement soon after treatment, but the main results develop gradually over several weeks to months as new collagen forms. The full effect is typically seen by three to six months."

        name: "How long do biostimulatory filler results last?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Because these fillers stimulate collagen, results can last up to two years or more. Many patients schedule maintenance treatments every 18 to 24 months to preserve collagen levels and extend the results."

        name: "Are biostimulatory fillers safe?",
        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Yes. When administered by a qualified medical professional, biostimulatory fillers are safe and effective. Side effects such as mild swelling, bruising, or tenderness are temporary. Since the product stimulates your own collagen, results appear natural and improve over time."

          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Biostimulatory fillers are ideal for restoring structure and firmness to the cheeks, jawline, temples, and lower face. They can also improve skin texture on the neck and décolletage. These fillers are not typically used in the lips or tear troughs."
