## The Best Botox Treatment Areas (and Why They Work)

Botox® (Botulinum Toxin) is one of the most popular non-surgical cosmetic treatments in the world, and for good reason. It’s safe, quick, and incredibly effective at softening wrinkles, relaxing facial tension, and giving your skin a smoother, more refreshed look. But here’s the question I hear all the time: Where exactly does Botox work best? Is it just the forehead or can it help other parts of the face too?  

Most people think of forehead lines or crow’s feet when they hear “Botox”, but there is actually a wide range of facial areas that can benefit from this treatment. From subtle lifting around the brows to smoothing out neck bands, Botox can do a lot more than just treat wrinkles. Let’s walk through the most common areas where Botox can be used, from the forehead down to the jawline. I’ll explain what each treatment does, why it matters, and how to decide what’s right for you.


## Botox Areas

### Where to Get Botox on the Upper Face

**Botox Between Eyebrows for Frown Line**  
This is one of the most requested Botox areas, and one of the most satisfying to treat. The vertical lines between your eyebrows (often called “11s” or glabellar lines) can make you look angry or tired, even when you’re not. Botox relaxes the muscles that cause this tension, softening your expression and restoring a calmer, more approachable look. In some cases, if the lines are deep, I might recommend adding a bit of dermal filler to directly fill the wrinkles.

**Forehead Botox for Lines and Wrinkles**  
Those horizontal lines that run across your forehead? They are often the first visible signs of aging. Botox in this area smooths those “surprise lines” and helps prevent them from deepening over time. Whether you’re in your 30s trying preventative treatment or already seeing visible creases, forehead Botox can make a big difference.

**Top of the Nose (Bunny Lines Botox)**  
When you scrunch your nose, whether smiling or sniffing, you might see little diagonal lines on the sides. These are called “bunny lines.” Botox in this area is a small, subtle tweak, but when placed carefully, it can soften those lines without affecting your natural smile.

**Hooded Eye Botox and Eyebrow Lift**  
As we age, the brows can start to droop and create a “hooded” effect on the upper eyelids. A bit of Botox, when injected strategically around the brow, can lift and open up the eyes, no surgery required. This is sometimes referred to as a “chemical brow lift.” The result? A fresher, more awake look. And don’t worry, I always aim for a natural brow shape, not the overarched “surprised” look.

**Around the Eyes (Crow’s Feet Botox)**  
Crow’s feet, those fine lines at the corners of the eyes, are some of the most noticeable and emotionally expressive wrinkles on the face. Whether you’re smiling, squinting, or laughing, this area gets a lot of use. Botox smooths these lines beautifully while still letting you show emotion. It’s one of the most common and rewarding areas to treat.

**Under the Eyes (Tear Trough Area)**  
Tiny lines and creases, commonly referred to as a “jelly roll”, beneath the eyes can also be treated with Botox, but this area requires a light hand. Too much product or poor placement can lead to eyelid drooping. In many cases, if your concern is volume loss or under-eye bags, dermal fillers may be a good option.


### Where to Get Botox on the Lower Face

**Botox Around the Mouth (Lipstick Lines)**  
The fine vertical lines around the mouth, often called lipstick lines or smoker’s lines, can be gently softened with Botox. This is a delicate area since these muscles also help you speak and smile. I commonly pair Botox with dermal filler here to smooth and hydrate the skin while preserving natural movement.

**Lip Flip with Botox**  
A lip flip is a quick, subtle treatment that uses a small amount of Botox to relax the muscles around the upper lip. This causes the lip to gently roll outward, creating the appearance of a fuller, more defined lip — without adding volume. It’s perfect if your top lip tends to disappear when you smile or if you want a soft enhancement without filler. Results typically last 6 to 8 weeks and look natural when done by a trained provider.

**Botox in the Chin (To Prevent Dimpling)**  
Over time, the chin muscle can become overactive, creating a pebbled or dimpled texture that makes the skin look uneven. Botox relaxes this area, smoothing the chin and improving overall facial balance. It’s a subtle but transformative treatment.

**Botox in the Jawline and Neck**  
For clients concerned about sagging skin, jowls, or visible neck bands, Botox can be used to tighten and contour the lower face and neck. This is often called the “Nefertiti lift.” By targeting the platysma muscles, we can soften horizontal neck lines or the rope-like vertical bands that appear when the neck is tense or aged. Combined with other treatments, it can create a refreshed, more lifted appearance.

**Jaw Angle (Botox for Teeth Grinding – Bruxism)**  
Do you grind your teeth at night or clench your jaw when stressed? Botox can help! Injecting Botox into the masseter muscles reduces jaw tension and pain from bruxism or TMJ. It can also slim the jawline over time, a great bonus for those who want a softer, more V-shaped facial contour.

I will assess your facial anatomy, listen to your concerns, and recommend the most natural-looking and effective treatment plan.

## Botox (Botulinum Toxin)

### Overview

**What Is Botox and How Does It Work?**  
Botox is a purified protein derived from botulinum toxin type A. It works by temporarily blocking nerve signals to specific muscles, which reduces movement and softens the appearance of wrinkles. When the muscle relaxes, the overlying skin smooths out, giving you a more refreshed, youthful look.  

It is not just for cosmetic use, either. Botox is FDA-approved for a range of medical conditions and has been used safely by trained professionals for decades.

### What Can Botox Treat?

**Cosmetic Uses**  
Botox is best known for reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but its benefits go beyond that. It’s commonly used to treat:

- Forehead lines and frown lines  
- Crow’s feet around the eyes  
- Drooping or heavy brows  
- Lip lines and lipstick wrinkles  
- Chin dimpling  
- Neck bands and sagging jawlines  
- Jaw tension or a square jaw caused by muscle overuse  

These treatments not only soften signs of aging but can also improve facial symmetry and relax overactive muscles that affect your appearance.

**Medical Uses**  
Botox also has a strong track record in treating medical concerns, including:

- TMJ and bruxism: Reduces jaw tension from clenching and grinding  
- Chronic migraines: FDA-approved to help prevent recurring migraines  
- Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating): Especially effective under the arms  
- Overactive bladder: Helps reduce urgent, frequent urination  
- Muscle spasms and pain: Used in certain neuromuscular disorders  

### Is Botox Safe?

Yes, when administered by a licensed, experienced provider, Botox is very safe. Side effects are usually mild and temporary, such as minor bruising or swelling at the injection site. Serious complications are rare, but I always review your health history first to make sure it’s the right treatment for you.

### What to Expect with Botox Treatment

Botox treatments are quick, minimally invasive, and typically done in under 15 minutes. During your visit, I’ll map your facial muscles by asking you to make a few expressions, then use a fine needle to place Botox exactly where it’s needed. Most clients describe it as a small pinch, nothing more.  

There’s no downtime, so you can get right back to your day.

### Botox Safety, Risks, and Results

When performed by a licensed medical professional, Botox is very safe. Most side effects are minor, like slight redness or swelling at the injection site. Serious complications are rare but can happen if Botox is administered incorrectly or in the wrong setting.  

Botox isn’t recommended during pregnancy, while breastfeeding, or for people with certain neuromuscular disorders, we’ll always review your health history first.  
You’ll start to see results within a few days, with full effects in about 2 weeks. Most people enjoy smoother, softer skin for 3 to 4 months before needing a touch-up.

### When to Call the Doctor

If you notice any unusual symptoms like drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, or signs of infection (even though they’re very rare) contact your provider immediately. It’s always better to check in early.


## FAQs About Botox

**Does Botox Hurt?**  
The needles are tiny, and most people describe it as a pinch. I pride myself on my light touch, but ice or numbing cream can be used if needed.  

**Can You Get Botox While Pregnant or Breastfeeding?**  
No. It is not recommended during pregnancy or while nursing.  

**What’s the Difference Between Botox and Fillers?**  
Botox relaxes muscles; fillers restore lost volume, but can offer some reduction in muscle movement. They often work beautifully together.  

**What Should I Know About Botox vs. Dysport vs. Jeuveau vs. Daxxify?**  
All four products (Botox, Dysport, Jeuveau, and Daxxify) are FDA-approved neuromodulators made from botulinum toxin type A. They work in very similar ways by temporarily relaxing targeted muscles to smooth wrinkles and fine lines. But there are a few key differences that may make one a better fit for you than the others:

- **Botox®** is the most well-known and widely used. It’s backed by decades of research and consistently delivers reliable results.  
- **Dysport®** tends to spread a bit more, which can be useful for treating larger areas like the forehead. It may also take effect slightly faster for some people.  
- **Jeuveau®** is often called the “new Botox” or “Botox for millennials.” It’s specifically designed for aesthetic use and sometimes priced more competitively.  
- **Daxxify®** is the newest on the market and known for its longer-lasting effects. While Botox typically lasts 3 to 4 months, Daxxify may last up to 6 months in some patients.  

In the real world, the differences are subtle, and many patients respond well to more than one. However, you may metabolize one faster than another, or you might prefer the onset time or longevity of a particular brand.

**Is It Safe to Get Botox After the COVID-19 Vaccine?**  
Yes. Botox is not the same as dermal fillers, and there’s no need to delay treatment after vaccination.
