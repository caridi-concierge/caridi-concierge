## Looking for Lip Injections in NYC? You’re in Good Company
Lip fillers and lip flips have become some of the most popular aesthetic treatments in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The goal is simple, natural, balanced lips that look refreshed, not overdone.
<br />
At Caridi Concierge, lip filler and Botox treatments are performed by me, [Cristina Caridi, MD](/staff/cristina-caridi), a board-certified physician who delivers private, in-home care across <b>Red Hook, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, and beyond</b>. Every treatment is doctor-led, personalized, and grounded in a simple philosophy: small, artful adjustments can make all the difference.

<br />

## What Are Lip Fillers?
<b>Lip fillers</b> are injectable treatments that restore or add volume to the lips using hyaluronic acid (HA), a naturally occurring substance in your body that keeps skin hydrated and plump. Over time, lips can lose volume due to aging, sun exposure, or genetics. A well-placed filler restores shape, smooths lines, and helps your lips reflect the youth and vitality you feel inside.
<br />
All treatments at Caridi Concierge use premium, FDA-approved fillers like <b>Juvederm Ultra XC and the RHA Collection</b>-each chosen for a reason. Some provide structure, others add softness or hydration. The goal is never to copy someone else’s lips, but to bring out your natural proportions in a way that feels seamless and real.

<br />

## Dr. Caridi’s Approach to Natural Lip Enhancement
To me, natural means undetectable. The people around you should notice that you look great, but not be able to put their finger on why.
<br />
I begin each lip consultation by looking at the entire face, its proportions, balance, and movement. <u>Your lips should be in harmony with the rest of your face.</u> If you have small, delicate features, a very full lip will likely look out of place. Respecting a patient’s anatomy and setting realistic expectations is vital to achieving beautiful, believable results.
<br />
In a world where trends like “Russian lips” dominate social media, I take a different approach. I don’t subscribe to trends in aesthetic medicine. Faces are meant to be unique, and chasing trends often leads to unnatural, odd appearances. <u>My responsibility is to give every patient the best result possible with the fewest interventions.</u>
<br />
My guiding principle is restraint. Subtlety and balance are everything. My goal is to make you look like your best self, not like someone else.

<br />

## Lip Flip vs Lip Filler: Which Is Right for You?
If you’ve searched <b>“lip flip near me”</b>, you’ve probably seen the buzz about this quick, non-filler alternative. A <b>lip flip</b> uses a small amount of Botox to relax the muscle above the upper lip, allowing it to gently roll upward. The result? A slightly fuller-looking top lip without adding volume.
<br />
A <b>lip flip</b> is a great, temporary way to <u>make your lips appear fuller</u>. It works by weakening the orbicularis oris muscle, the one you use for speaking or sipping through a straw. You might notice that those movements feel different for a few weeks, but the effect is temporary and usually very well tolerated.
<br />
<b>Lip filler</b>, on the other hand, <u>adds actual volume and structure using hyaluronic acid</u>. Some patients choose one or the other, but combining both can beautifully balance the lips, soft lift from Botox, structure from filler.

## What to Expect During Your In-Home Appointment
An in-home lip injection appointment with Caridi Concierge feels completely different from visiting a busy medspa. There’s no waiting room, no rush, and no distractions. Just one-on-one medical care in the privacy of your own space.

### Before Treatment
Each visit begins with a detailed consultation. I will observe facial expressions, listen to goals, and create a plan based on your anatomy. Watching a patient animate, smile, speak, make a kissy face, tells me a lot about whether a lip flip would be beneficial or if filler alone is best.

### During Treatment
A numbing cream keeps the process comfortable. Using a fine needle or micro-cannula, filler is placed strategically to enhance natural shape and symmetry. The treatment takes about 20-30 minutes, and results are visible right away.

### Aftercare and Recovery
Mild swelling and bruising are normal. I remind patients to avoid alcohol and NSAIDs like ibuprofen, as these can increase bruising. Use cold compresses for 24 hours and avoid manipulating the lips for a few days. Some swelling is expected, but I stay available for any questions during the healing period.
Most swelling resolves within 3-5 days, and final results settle within two weeks.

<br />

## Why In-Home Aesthetic Care Changes Everything
Having your lip filler or Botox treatment at home isn’t just convenient, it’s calming. In familiar surroundings, patients feel more relaxed and open. <b>I bring a full medical setup with me, maintaining the same standards of cleanliness and safety as a clinic, but with a more personal touch.</b>
<br />
<br />
Patients are often surprised by how peaceful it feels. We can take our time, adjust lighting, play music, and talk through every step. It’s a calm, human experience, never transactional.
This concierge model also makes follow-ups effortless. If you need a small touch-up or want to explore other treatments like wrinkle reduction or filler balance, it all happens on your schedule, in your space.

## Safety, Longevity, and Reversibility
Lip fillers are very safe when performed by a trained medical professional. All products used by Caridi Concierge are FDA-approved and fully reversible.
Lip fillers made of hyaluronic acid can be safely dissolved with an enzyme called hyaluronidase. You can remove lumps or migration while keeping the rest intact, or completely dissolve everything if needed. It gives patients control and peace of mind.
<br />
<b>Results typically last 6-12 months, depending on lifestyle and filler type.</b> Many patients choose maintenance treatments every 9 months to stay consistent without overfilling.

<br />

## How to Maintain Your Results
After your treatment, focus on hydration, sun protection, and gentle care. Drink water, use a nourishing lip balm, and avoid smoking, which can accelerate filler breakdown.
Touch-ups are optional but often done once or twice a year for best results. I encourage small, gradual enhancements over time. They look more natural and keep the lips healthy long-term.
