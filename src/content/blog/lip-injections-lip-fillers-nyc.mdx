## Looking for Lip Injections in NYC? You’re in Good Company

Lip injections, lip fillers and lip flips have become some of the most popular aesthetic treatments in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The goal is simple: natural, balanced lips that look refreshed, not overdone.

At Caridi Concierge, all lip treatments are performed by me, [Cristina Caridi, MD](/staff/cristina-caridi), a board certified physician who delivers private, in home care across Red Hook, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and beyond. Every treatment is doctor led, personalized and grounded in a simple philosophy. Small, artful adjustments can make all the difference.

<br />

## Quick Overview: Lip Injections, Lip Fillers and Lip Flips

### What are lip injections?  
Lip injections typically refer to hyaluronic acid lip fillers. These fillers add soft, natural volume, shape and hydration to the lips.

### What are lip fillers?  
Lip fillers are injectable treatments that use hyaluronic acid to enhance lip volume, smooth lines and improve definition.

### What is a lip flip?  
A lip flip uses a small amount of Botox to relax the muscle above the upper lip. This allows the lip to gently flip upward, creating the appearance of a slightly fuller top lip without adding volume.

### How long do lip injections last?  
Most hyaluronic acid lip fillers last 6 to 12 months depending on lifestyle and how your body metabolizes the product.

### How long does a lip flip last?  
A lip flip typically lasts about 2 to 3 months before a touch up may be needed.

## What Are Lip Injections (Lip Fillers)

Lip injections, often called lip fillers, use hyaluronic acid to restore or add volume to the lips. Over time, lips can lose fullness due to aging, sun exposure or genetics. A well placed filler restores shape, smooths lines and helps your lips look refreshed without appearing overfilled.

At Caridi Concierge, treatments use premium FDA approved fillers such as Juvederm Ultra XC and the RHA Collection. Each product is chosen for a purpose. Some provide structure. Others add softness or hydration. The goal is never to copy someone else’s lips. The goal is to bring out your natural proportions in a way that feels seamless and real.

<br />

## Dr. Caridi’s Approach to Natural Lip Enhancement

To me, natural means undetectable. You should look like yourself, only more balanced.

I begin each consultation by assessing the entire face, its proportions, balance and movement. Your lips should complement your facial features. If you have delicate features, a very full lip can look out of place. Respecting your anatomy and setting realistic goals is essential.

Trends like “Russian lips” may dominate social media. I take a different approach. Faces are meant to be unique. Chasing trends often creates unnatural results. My responsibility is to give you the best outcome possible with the fewest interventions.

My guiding principle is restraint. Subtlety and balance are everything.

<br />

## Lip Flip vs Lip Filler: Which Option Fits Your Goals

If you have searched “lip flip near me,” you have likely seen the buzz around this quick, non filler alternative.

A lip flip uses a small amount of Botox to relax the muscle above the upper lip. This allows the lip to roll upward for a slightly fuller look without changing volume.

A lip flip is ideal for a gentle, temporary enhancement. It can improve how the upper lip shows when you smile and soften fine lines around the mouth.

Lip filler adds actual volume and structure. It creates fuller lips, softens lines and corrects asymmetry. Many patients choose a combination of both for the most balanced and natural result.

## What to Expect During Your In Home Appointment

An in home lip injection appointment feels very different from visiting a busy medspa. There is no waiting room, no rush and no distractions. Just one on one medical care in the privacy of your home.

### Before Treatment  
Each visit begins with a detailed consultation. I observe your expressions, listen to your goals and create a plan based on your anatomy.

### During Treatment  
A numbing cream keeps the process comfortable. Using a fine needle or micro cannula, filler is placed strategically to enhance natural shape and symmetry.

### Aftercare and Recovery  
Mild swelling and bruising are normal. Cold compresses help for the first 24 hours. Avoid alcohol and NSAIDs since they can increase bruising. Most swelling resolves in 3 to 5 days. Final results settle within two weeks.

<br />

## Risks and Side Effects of Lip Injections

Lip injections are safe when performed by a trained medical professional using sterile technique and FDA approved products. Most side effects are mild, including:

- temporary tenderness  
- mild swelling  
- bruising  
- a feeling of fullness  

More serious complications, such as vascular occlusion, are rare but possible. This is why it is important to see a provider who understands facial anatomy and can treat complications if they occur. Hyaluronic acid fillers can be dissolved with an enzyme called hyaluronidase if needed.

<br />

## How Long Do Lip Fillers Last?

Lip fillers usually last 6 to 12 months depending on lifestyle, product type and individual metabolism. Many patients choose maintenance treatments every 9 months to stay consistent without overfilling.

<br />

## Why In Home Aesthetic Care Changes Everything

In home aesthetic care is calming and convenient. In familiar surroundings, patients feel more relaxed. I bring a full medical setup with me and maintain the same standards of cleanliness and safety as a clinic, with a more personal touch.

Follow ups are effortless. If you need a touch up or want to explore other treatments such as wrinkle reduction or filler balancing, it all happens on your schedule.

<br />

## How to Maintain Your Lip Filler Results

After your treatment, stay hydrated, use sun protection and treat the lips gently. Avoid smoking since it can accelerate filler breakdown. Touch ups can be done once or twice a year for best results. Small, gradual enhancements look most natural over time.
