# Understanding How Botox Actually Works

## What Is Botox and How Does It Work?

### Botox Overview

Hi there! I'm Dr. Cristina Caridi, and if you've ever wondered what Botox actually does, you came to the right place. Botox injections are one of the most popular cosmetic treatments out there, but they do so much more than just smooth out wrinkles. Botox uses a purified form of botulinum toxin to temporarily relax muscles. This can help soften facial lines and also treat a bunch of medical conditions like migraines, excessive sweating, and even overactive bladder!

Botox is the most recognizable brand name for botulinum toxin A (BoNTA), which is used to temporarily paralyze or relax muscles, though now we have several trusted brands that are all safe and effective. These include Xeomin, Daxxify, Juveau, and Dysport. I will refer to BoNTA as Botox in this article for consistency. Botox was first approved to treat eye conditions and muscle spasms, and cosmetic use came later. Botox blocks nerve signals to the muscles being treated, which stops them from contracting. That means smoother skin due to less facial muscle movement and reduced pain from muscle spasm such as in the shoulders or TMJ.

Botulinum toxin comes from a bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. Botulism is a serious condition caused by infection with Clostridium botulinum. Botox is a cleaned and purified version, and is safe when used in small amounts. Botox is very safe when administered by a trained medical provider. It is best to avoid it if you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or have certain neuromuscular conditions, so be sure to let your provider know about any medical history.

## Getting Botox: What To Expect

**How to Prepare**  
Avoid alcohol and blood thinners including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 24 hours before treatment. Tell your provider about any recent Botox treatments, medications, or if you‚Äôre taking supplements that increase bruising.

**The Appointment**  
Botox injections are generally well tolerated, but we can use numbing cream for particularly sensitive areas including the palms and soles. I use a tiny needle to inject small amounts of Botox into targeted muscles. The number of injections depends on your goals and treatment area.  

Your provider will map out your treatment plan based on your unique anatomy and concerns.  

The procedure itself lasts between 5-10 minutes depending on how many areas are being treated.

**Aftercare and Results**  
Stay upright for a few hours, don‚Äôt rub the area, and avoid intense exercise for 24 hours. This helps prevent the Botox from moving into areas it shouldn't.  

You‚Äôll usually start seeing results within 3‚Äì5 days, with full effects showing in about 2 weeks. Results typically last 3 to 4 months. Regular appointments are necessary to maintain your results. The occasional touch up at the 2 week mark may be necessary to achieve your goals, though it is generally not recommended to receive Botox treatments more frequently than every 3 months as it is possible to become ‚Äúimmune‚Äù to Botox. 


## Is Botox Right for You?

**Risks and Side Effects**  
Botox is safe when administered by a trained professional. Side effects are usually mild but can include:

- Bruising or swelling  
- Headache or flu-like symptoms  
- Temporary droopy eyelids or uneven eyebrows  

Rarely, it can spread to other parts of the body and cause symptoms like trouble swallowing or breathing. Always call your provider if anything feels off.

**Who Should Avoid Botox?**  
If you're pregnant, nursing, or have neuromuscular diseases (eg Myasthenia Gravis, Lambert-Eaton), Botox might not be for you. Talk to your provider first.

**When To Call Your Doctor**  
Call your healthcare provider immediately if you experience:

- Vision changes  
- Trouble breathing  
- Difficulty swallowing  
- Muscle weakness away from the injection site
