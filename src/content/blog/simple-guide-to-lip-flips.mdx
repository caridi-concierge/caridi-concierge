## Overview

**What is a lip flip?**  
A lip flip is a simple, non-surgical cosmetic procedure that enhances the look of your upper lip by using a small amount of botulinum toxin, such as Botox. When injected into targeted areas around the mouth, the treatment relaxes the muscles and causes the upper lip to gently "flip" outward. This creates a naturally fuller-looking lip without changing its actual volume or structure.

**What are the types of botulinum toxin injections?**  
While BotoxÂ® is the most well-known brand, it's not the only option available. Your provider might recommend alternatives like DaxxifyÂ®, DysportÂ®, XeominÂ®, or JeuveauÂ® based on your individual goals and response to treatment. Each of these products uses the same core ingredient but varies slightly in formulation and spread.

**What is the difference between a lip flip and lip fillers?**  
A lip flip and lip fillers can both improve the appearance of your lips, but they work in very different ways. Hyaluronic acid fillers (RHA, Juvederm for example) are used to directly add volume to the lips, and give instant results. A lip flip uses botulinum toxin (Botox) to relax the muscle around the mouth, the orbicularis oris, allowing the lip to subtly flip outwards, showing more of your natural lip. The result is subtle but can be very impactful. We can use a combination of lip flip and lip filler to achieve your desired look. Or, if you're curious about enhancing your lips but arenâ€™t ready to commit to lip filler, a lip flip is a great starting point.

**Who is a good candidate for a lip flip?**  
A lip flip can be a wonderful option for those who want to subtly enhance their smile. Patients often choose this treatment if their upper lip tends to disappear when they smile or if the upper lip has started to pull inwards with age. It can also be used to treat smokersâ€™ lines - the fine lines that appear above the upper lip.

**How long does a lip flip last?**  
The effects of a lip flip are temporary, typically lasting between three to six months. Regular treatments are recommended to maintain your desired look and prevent fine lines around the mouth.


## Procedure Details

**What happens before a lip flip procedure?**  
Before the treatment, you'll have a consultation to discuss your goals and evaluate your suitability for the procedure. Your provider will review your medical history, current medications, and any allergies you may have. You will be advised to avoid alcohol, aspirin, and smoking for several days beforehand to reduce the risk of bruising. Photos will also be taken to track your progress.

**What happens during a lip flip procedure?**  
The treatment itself is very quick and typically doesn't require any numbing. Using a very fine needle, your provider will carefully inject a small amount of Botox into the muscle above your upper lip. You might feel a brief pinch, but the procedure is generally very well tolerated.  

**What happens after a lip flip procedure?**  
Once the procedure is complete, you'll be monitored briefly to ensure there are no immediate side effects. Most people experience only mild tenderness or swelling, which subsides within a day. You're free to go about your day, but it's important to avoid putting pressure on your lips, using straws, or applying lip products for a few days to allow the treatment to settle.


## Risks / Benefits

**What are the advantages of a lip flip?**  
A lip flip offers a subtle approach to lip enhancement. It gently enhances the upper lip, creates a balanced smile, and reduces or prevents fine lines around the mouth. The lack of downtime and quick recovery make it an appealing choice for those with busy schedules.

**What are the risks of a lip flip?**  
As with any procedure, there are potential risks. Some people may experience difficulty drinking through a straw, whistling, or pronouncing certain words. In rare cases, the muscle may relax too much, leading to drooling or a temporary change in lip movement. These effects resolve as the Botox wears off. Choosing a trained and experienced provider significantly reduces these risks.

**Can you get a lip flip while pregnant?**  
There isn't enough research to confirm that botulinum toxin is safe during pregnancy, so it is not recommended to receive Botox cosmetic treatments while pregnant.


## Recovery and Outlook

**What is the recovery time?**  
Typically there is no downtime. You may experience some mild bruising or swelling that will resolve within a few days.  Visit our [Botox treatment page](/treatments/wrinkle-reduction) for more information.

**How soon will I see results?**  
Depending on which product is used, results will be visible within a few days to 2 weeks. If you're planning to show off your new smile at an event, it is recommended to schedule the procedure at least two weeks in advance.

**When can I eat or drink after getting a lip flip?**  
You can eat and drink soon after the treatment, but you should avoid hot drinks, straws, or anything that puts pressure on your lips for a few days. Be gentle when brushing your teeth, and skip alcohol for at least 24 hours to reduce the risk of bruising.

**Confidence and Mental Health Benefits**  
Cosmetic procedures like the lip flip may seem purely aesthetic, but for many people, the emotional impact can be just as meaningful as the physical result. For those who have always been self-conscious about thin lips or a crooked smile, even a minor change can make a major difference in self-esteem. Feeling more comfortable in your smile can translate into greater confidence in social settings, work interactions, and photos. It's not just about how you lookâ€”it's about how you carry yourself, how you connect with others, and how you feel in your own skin. That's what we aim to support at Caridi Concierge: confidence that comes from within, with a little help on the outside.
