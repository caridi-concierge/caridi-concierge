# How to Prepare for Botox: Your Complete Pre- and Post-Treatment Guide

Getting ready for your first (or next) Botox appointment? Whether you're hoping to smooth out fine lines or give your face a refreshed look, how you prepare can make a big difference.  

I’m Dr. Cristina Caridi, and I want to walk you through everything you need to know so you feel confident, informed, and excited about your treatment!  

Let’s talk through the big-picture essentials so you get the most out of your Botox experience, from who you choose to work with to what to eat, drink, and avoid before and after.


## Choosing the Right Provider and Planning Your Consultation

First things first: Botox is a medical procedure, and it should be treated like one. Always work with a licensed and experienced provider who understands facial anatomy. A skilled injector can tailor your treatment to your unique facial structure, ensuring results that look natural, not frozen.

Before we treat, we consult. A consultation is your opportunity to talk through your goals, share your medical history, and ask any questions you may have. During our meeting, I’ll also go over what to expect during the appointment, potential risks, and how to care for your skin after treatment.

Transparent pricing is also important. Botox cost depends on the number of units and the area being treated. Make sure you understand the total cost ahead of time so there are no surprises. At Caridi Concierge, I always break things down clearly so you know exactly what to expect.


## Timing, Medications, and Lifestyle Adjustments

Botox has little to no downtime, but it's smart to plan your appointment a couple of weeks before any big events. That way, if you have a bit of swelling or minor bruising, your skin will have plenty of time to settle and glow.

In the days before your appointment, you’ll want to avoid anything that increases bruising risk. That includes medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, fish oil, and vitamin E. If you're taking any of these for medical reasons, talk to your doctor before stopping. And be sure to tell your provider about all prescriptions, over-the-counter meds, and supplements. Safety first, always.  

Alcohol also may increase your risk of bruising, so if this is a concern for you, it is best to abstain for at least 24h prior to your appointment.

It’s also a good idea to skip harsh skincare treatments like chemical peels or facial waxing for at least a week prior. Your skin should be calm and balanced on the day of your treatment.


## Day-of Prep: What to Do Before Your Appointment

On the day of your appointment, come in with a clean face. Some clients ask about numbing cream or ice packs — both are optional and can be discussed during your consultation.

Make sure to hydrate! Drinking water helps your skin and body function better, and well-hydrated skin tends to respond more smoothly to Botox. Eat a light, healthy meal beforehand and avoid alcohol. You’ll feel better during and after the treatment.

If you’re planning to exercise that day, get it done before your appointment. For the first 24 hours afterward, it’s best to skip workouts, saunas, hot yoga, and anything else that heats up the body or puts pressure on your face. Strenuous exercise may cause the product to move outside of its intended target muscle and cause unwanted side effects.

## Aftercare and Realistic Expectations

Once the Botox is in, your job is to let it settle. That means no rubbing, touching, or lying down for several hours. You may reapply your makeup about an hour after treatment, but skip any skincare products that might irritate the injection sites. Cold compresses can help with swelling if needed. Arnica may help with bruising.

One of the biggest myths about Botox is that results are instant. They’re not! You’ll typically start to see changes in 2 to 5 days, with full results showing in about 1 to 2 weeks. The effects usually last 3 to 4 months, depending on your metabolism and the areas treated. Follow-up treatments help maintain the look and keep those fine lines from sneaking back in.

Another tip? Good skin makes Botox look even better. Keeping up a solid skincare routine, with hydration, SPF, and retinol if appropriate, goes a long way.


## Make the Experience Enjoyable

A Botox appointment shouldn’t feel like a chore. At Caridi Concierge, I bring the treatment to you, in the comfort and privacy of your home. No crowded waiting rooms, no rushed appointments. Just calm, personalized care.

Some of my clients even book their Botox sessions with a friend — it makes the experience fun and relaxing.  

If this is your first time being treated with Botox, it is normal to feel nervous. I will walk you through every step so you know exactly what is happening and why. My goal is to make you feel empowered and comfortable, from start to finish.
