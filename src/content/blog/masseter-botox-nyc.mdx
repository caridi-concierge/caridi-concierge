## In Search of Jawline Slimming or TMJ Relief in NYC?

Tight jaw? Morning headaches? A square lower face that feels heavier than it used to?
You might be dealing with an overactive masseter muscle - a strong jaw muscle responsible for chewing and clenching.
At Caridi Concierge, I treat patients across New York City who struggle with jaw tension, teeth grinding, or facial asymmetry caused by this powerful muscle. With a few small, precise injections of Masseter Botox, we can relax the area, relieve discomfort, and create a slimmer, more balanced jawline, all from the privacy and comfort of your home.

## What Is Masseter Botox and How It Works
The masseter runs along the sides of your face, connecting your cheekbone to your jaw. When this muscle overworks (often from stress, clenching, or chewing), it can enlarge and harden over time. The result: facial tightness, TMJ pain, and a broader jawline.
Masseter Botox works by injecting a purified protein (botulinum toxin) into this muscle. It gently reduces muscle activity, giving it a chance to rest. As the muscle relaxes, symptoms like clenching and tension ease, and the jawline gradually softens, restoring balance to your face.
Masseter Botox serves as both a medical treatment and an aesthetic one depending on the patient’s needs. For some, it’s about relieving TMJ pain. For others, it’s about refining the jawline. Often, it’s both.

## Why Patients Choose Masseter Botox

### Relief from TMJ Pain and Jaw Tension
TMJ pain can be exhausting. Some patients experience headaches, clicking, or even difficulty chewing. Others have fractured teeth from years of grinding. By calming the masseter muscle, Botox for TMJ eases pressure on the joint and allows the entire area to reset. Many patients say they wake up with a relaxed jaw for the first time in years.

### Slimmer, Softer Jawline
When the masseter overgrows, it can create a square, boxy look. Over time, as the treated muscle becomes less active, it naturally decreases in size creating a gentle slimming effect and more defined facial shape. Think of it as balance, not alteration.

### Natural Confidence, No Surgery
Masseter botox/jawline slimming involves no incisions, scars, or downtime. The effect is subtle and graceful. Your face, only softer and more harmonious.

<br />

## What to Expect During Your Appointment
### A Private Consultation
Every appointment begins with a conversation. I’ll assess your facial anatomy, listen to your goals, and determine the exact injection points for your treatment. If the concern is TMJ pain, I may start conservatively. If we’re focusing on contouring, we’ll plan a more targeted aesthetic approach.

### Comfortable, Professional Setup
Even though your treatment happens at home, every step is medical-grade. I bring sterile instruments, gloves, disinfectants, and sharps containers to create a clean, controlled environment. Many of my patients tell me they feel more at ease here than in any office, especially those who are nervous around needles or medical settings.
My patients love to be treated at home because that’s where they feel most comfortable. They enjoy the privacy and convenience, and I find they’re more relaxed and open when we’re in their own space.

### Quick and Gentle Procedure
After cleansing the area, I use a fine needle to inject small, precise doses into each side of the jaw. Most people describe the sensation as a quick pinch. The entire process takes 30-45 minutes, and there’s no recovery time, you can return to your normal day right after.
You’ll want to avoid rubbing the area or intense exercise for 24 hours, but otherwise, it’s simple and seamless.

For first-time patients, the effect may be more subtle because the muscle hasn’t yet atrophied. With consistent treatments, results become more pronounced and longer-lasting.

## A Personalized Approach to Treatment
Each patient’s anatomy and goals are unique. Some people benefit from Botox for TMJ alone; others combine it with small touches like chin filler or skin-tightening treatments for a balanced profile.
There’s no 'template'. Every session is designed for your face, your comfort, and your confidence.
My goal is to correct problem areas while keeping the work undetectable. Your injectables should make you look your best, not done up.

<br />

## Aftercare and Follow-Up
After your appointment, I personally check in with every patient-first the next day, and again later in the healing process. You’ll have my direct number and email for any questions or updates. My patients know they can reach me anytime, and they always receive a prompt response.
That level of connection is what makes Caridi Concierge different. This isn’t a “treatment and goodbye” service; it’s a relationship built on trust and ongoing care.

<br />

## Real-Life Relief: TMJ Pain to Peace of Mind
One of my patients came to me after years of TMJ pain that made chewing uncomfortable and caused frequent headaches. Within a week of her first treatment, she told me she could finally eat without soreness. By her second session, her jawline looked softer, and she hadn’t worn her nightguard in months.
Stories like hers remind me that masseter Botox isn’t just cosmetic-it can dramatically improve someone’s daily comfort and confidence.

<br />

## How Much Does Masseter Botox Cost in NYC?
Pricing varies by anatomy and dosage, but most treatments range from $600-$800 per session in New York City.
At Caridi Concierge, every treatment is performed by a physician, not a technician, ensuring accuracy and safety. Patients often find the value extends beyond the results-they appreciate the comfort, privacy, and personalized care of concierge treatment.

## FAQs About Botox
- **Can masseter Botox help with TMJ?**
    Yes. TMJ Botox reduces pressure in the jaw joint, easing pain, headaches, and grinding. It’s a safe, non-surgical solution for patients who want lasting relief.
- **Will it change my smile or chewing?**
    When done correctly, no. The treatment targets only the masseter, leaving your facial expressions and smile intact.
- **Can I eat after my treatment?**
    Yes! Just avoid hard or chewy foods right after your session and refrain from pressing on the treated area for 24 hours.
- **How often should I repeat it?**
    Every 4-6 months is typical. Over time, the muscle learns to stay relaxed, so you may need it less frequently.
- **Is Botox safe at home?**
    Absolutely. Every treatment follows the same sterile standards as a medical clinic-just in a space where you feel more at ease.
