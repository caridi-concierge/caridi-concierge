## Lip Filler Migration Explained - What Causes It and How to Prevent It

Hi, I‚Äôm Dr. Cristina Caridi. If your lip filler doesn‚Äôt look quite right anymore, maybe it‚Äôs puffy above your lips or your borders seem blurry, you‚Äôre not alone. Lip filler migration is something I get asked about all the time, and the good news is: it can be fixed. In this post, we‚Äôll go over what lip filler migration is, why it happens, how to avoid it, and what to do if it‚Äôs already happened to you.


## What is lip filler migration?

Lip filler migration is when the filler moves from where it was originally placed. This can create a swollen look above the lip (often called a ‚Äúfiller mustache‚Äù), or make the lips look uneven or overfilled. Migration is common in the lips because the lips move so much.

## What causes lip filler migration?

### Incorrect Injection Technique  
If filler is placed too close to the surface or injected too quickly, it can spread into the wrong areas.

### Too Much Filler  
Overfilling the lips doesn‚Äôt just create an unnatural look. It can also stretch the skin beyond its natural capacity and cause the filler to shift into unwanted places.

### Wrong Type of Filler  
Some fillers are too soft or watery for the lips and are more likely to move. Choosing the right product is just as important as the technique.

### Frequent Top-Ups  
Layering new filler on top of old filler repeatedly over years without dissolving it can push the product out of place over time.

### Aftercare Mistakes  
Rubbing or pressing your lips after treatment can cause the filler to shift. It‚Äôs important to follow the aftercare instructions your injector gives you.


### What are the signs of filler migration?
- Puffiness above the lip line  
- Blurry or undefined lip borders  
- Lips look stiff or overly full  
- Lumps or uneven areas  
- A duck-like or protruded appearance

## How to Fix Lip Filler Migration

### Schedule a Consultation  
First, get your lips evaluated by a professional who knows what to look for. Sometimes, what seems like migration may just be swelling or natural changes in the filler.

### Dissolve the Filler  
If migration is confirmed, a simple treatment with an enzyme called hyaluronidase can break down the filler. Most people need 1‚Äì3 sessions.

### Wait Before Refilling  
Once the filler is dissolved, it‚Äôs best to wait at least 2 weeks before doing another treatment. This gives your lips time to heal.

In some cases, yes‚Äîbut it can take months or even years. Most people choose to dissolve it for faster and more reliable results.

**Can I get more filler if I have migration?**  
It‚Äôs not recommended. Adding new filler on top of migrated filler can make things worse. Always dissolve before refilling.
