## Lip Filler Migration Explained - What Causes It and How to Prevent It

Hi, I’m [Dr. Cristina Caridi](/staff/cristina-caridi). If your lip filler doesn’t look quite right anymore, maybe it’s puffy above your lips or your borders seem blurry, you’re not alone. Lip filler migration is something I get asked about all the time, and the good news is: it can be fixed. In this post, we’ll go over what lip filler migration is, why it happens, how to avoid it, and what to do if it’s already happened to you.


## What is lip filler migration?

Lip filler migration is when the filler moves from where it was originally placed. This can create a swollen look above the lip (often called a “filler mustache”), or make the lips look uneven or overfilled. Migration is common in the lips because the lips move so much.

## What causes lip filler migration?

### Incorrect Injection Technique  
If filler is placed too close to the surface or injected too quickly, it can spread into the wrong areas.

### Too Much Filler  
Overfilling the lips doesn’t just create an unnatural look. It can also stretch the skin beyond its natural capacity and cause the filler to shift into unwanted places.

### Wrong Type of Filler  
Some fillers are too soft or watery for the lips and are more likely to move. Choosing the right product is just as important as the technique.

### Frequent Top-Ups  
Layering new filler on top of old filler repeatedly over years without dissolving it can push the product out of place over time.

### Aftercare Mistakes  
Rubbing or pressing your lips after treatment can cause the filler to shift. It’s important to follow the aftercare instructions your injector gives you.


### What are the signs of filler migration?
- Puffiness above the lip line  
- Blurry or undefined lip borders  
- Lips look stiff or overly full  
- Lumps or uneven areas  
- A duck-like or protruded appearance

## How to Fix Lip Filler Migration

### Schedule a Consultation  
First, get your lips evaluated by a professional who knows what to look for. Sometimes, what seems like migration may just be swelling or natural changes in the filler.

### Dissolve the Filler  
If migration is confirmed, a simple treatment with an enzyme called hyaluronidase can break down the filler. Most people need 1–3 sessions.

### Wait Before Refilling  
Once the filler is dissolved, it’s best to wait at least 2 weeks before doing another treatment. This gives your lips time to heal.

## FAQs About Lip Filler

**Will migrated filler go away on its own?**  
In some cases, yes—but it can take months or even years. Most people choose to dissolve it for faster and more reliable results.

**Can I get more filler if I have migration?**  
It’s not recommended. Adding new filler on top of migrated filler can make things worse. Always dissolve before refilling.

**How long should I wait after dissolving filler to get treated again?**  
Most providers recommend waiting at least 2 weeks to allow the filler to completely dissolve and the lips to heal properly. Some people wait even longer for optimal results.

Yes! At Caridi Concierge, all lip filler treatments and dissolving procedures are done by Dr. Caridi, a licensed physician using only medical-grade products and techniques.
