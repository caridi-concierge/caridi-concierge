## Looking for Chin Botox or Chin Filler in NYC?

The <strong>chin plays a quiet but powerful role in how balanced and defined the face looks</strong>. Even small changes in this area can affect the entire profile. You may notice dimpling when you speak, a softer or recessed chin in photos, or new shadows that make the lower face look less smooth than it used to. These details are subtle, yet they have a meaningful impact on how the face reads as a whole.

<br />

At Caridi Concierge, <strong>I focus on creating results that are elegant and subtle.</strong> The goal is not to change your features. It is to refine the structure that is already there so that everything looks naturally harmonious. Chin Botox and chin filler are two of the most effective tools for achieving this, and each one addresses a different type of concern.

<br />

Below, I explain how both treatments work, who they are best for and what you can expect throughout the process.

<br />

### What is chin Botox?

Chin Botox uses a small amount of botulinum toxin to relax the mentalis muscle in the chin. When this muscle is overactive, it can create dimpling, creasing and an orange peel texture. By calming the muscle, Botox smooths the surface of the chin and softens the appearance of lines.

<br />

### What is chin filler?

Chin filler uses hyaluronic acid based dermal fillers to add structure and projection to the chin. The filler is placed deep on the bone to strengthen the foundation of the lower face. This can improve a recessed chin, correct asymmetry and sharpen the profile without surgery.

<br />

### What is the difference between chin Botox and chin filler?

Chin Botox treats <strong>movement and texture</strong>. It is best for dimpling and overactive muscle. Chin filler treats <strong>shape and structure</strong>. It is best for a weak, recessed or uneven chin. Many patients benefit from a combination of both, depending on their specific concerns.

<br />

## Why does the chin change over time?

The chin is shaped by both muscle activity and underlying bone structure. When the <u>mentalis muscle becomes overactive</u>, the skin can pucker or dimple. This often becomes more noticeable as we age. At the same time, volume loss in the lower face can create deeper shadows, a weaker profile or a chin that appears shorter or less projected.

<br />

These changes are normal. They happen slowly, which is why many people do not realize how much the chin influences the entire face until they see a photo or video of themselves from the side. The good news is that targeted injections can make the chin appear smoother, clearer and better defined. Chin Botox and chin filler each play a unique role in that process.

<br />

## Chin Botox for dimpling and a smoother lower face

Chin Botox softens an overactive mentalis muscle. When this muscle contracts too strongly, it creates the uneven or pebbled texture many people call the <b>orange peel chin</b>. It can also pull the skin upward and contribute to folds or lines at rest.

Botox calms this activity. Once the muscle relaxes, the surface of the chin appears smoother and more even. The improvement is subtle but meaningful. Patients often feel that their expression looks less tense and more relaxed, even when no one else can pinpoint what changed.

<br />

### How does chin Botox work?

Botox blocks the signal that tells the mentalis muscle to contract. As the muscle relaxes, the skin no longer creases or puckers. The effect builds gradually over several days, and the result is a soft, natural looking chin that moves more gracefully.

<br />

### Who benefits most from chin Botox?

Chin Botox is ideal for anyone who notices dimpling, pulling or excessive movement with animation. It can also help people who feel that the chin looks tight, strained or uneven.

<br />

### Why does dosing matter in the chin?

The chin metabolizes Botox quickly. For this reason, very low doses tend to fade faster and leave the muscle partially active. I prefer a more complete treatment, usually 8 to 10 units, which creates smoother and longer lasting results without freezing the area.

<br />

<br />

## Hyaluronic acid chin filler for projection and profile definition

While Botox relaxes the muscle, chin filler adds structure. If the chin is recessed, lacks projection or appears uneven, filler can create a clearer and more defined shape. It enhances the profile and improves the transition between the lower face and the neck.

Filler is placed deep on the bone to strengthen the foundation of the chin. This placement keeps the result looking structural rather than puffy. The goal is to create lift and definition, not visible volume.

<br />

### What can chin filler improve?

Chin filler can address:

- a recessed or under projected chin  
- asymmetry  
- uneven contour  
- chin shadows  
- a softer or less defined profile  

Even a small amount of filler can make the jawline appear more balanced and proportionate.

<br />

### Product choices and why they matter

For structure and support, I rely on fillers such as RHA 4 or Juvederm Voluma. They are firm enough to hold shape while still looking natural. For fine textural concerns, lighter fillers such as Redensity or Restylane Refyne can be layered for a smooth finish without adding heaviness. Visit our [Trusted Products](/products) page to learn more about these options.

<br />

### How long does chin filler last?

Most chin fillers last 9 to 18 months depending on the product used and your individual facial structure.

<br />

## When do chin Botox and chin filler work best together?

Sometimes both movement and structure need attention. In those cases, combining Botox and filler creates the most natural result.

The sequence matters. I usually relax the mentalis muscle first. When the muscle is calm, the skin rests more evenly, which allows filler to sit smoothly. Once everything is stable, filler can restore projection or correct asymmetry. This combination creates a refined, balanced result that blends seamlessly into your natural features.

The key is restraint. Chasing symmetry or adding too much volume can create an unnatural appearance. My philosophy is simple. The best work is invisible. You should look refreshed and confident without anyone noticing that you had treatment.

## Risks and benefits of chin Botox and chin filler

### What are the benefits?

- smoother, more even chin texture  
- softer, less tense expression  
- improved chin projection and profile  
- better balance between the chin and lower face  
- non surgical treatment with little to no downtime  

<br />

### What are the risks or side effects?

Most side effects are mild and temporary. These may include:

- tenderness, redness or bruising at the injection sites  
- temporary swelling  
- mild asymmetry as the product settles  

More significant issues are uncommon but can include unintended muscle weakness or, in the case of filler, vascular complications. Choosing a trained, experienced physician for your treatment greatly reduces these risks.

<br />

## Avoiding an unnatural result

Overfilling the chin is a common mistake. Adding too much product or placing it in the wrong plane can distort the profile. <u>It can also draw too much attention to the lower face.</u>

My approach avoids these pitfalls. I use conservative amounts and rely on careful placement rather than volume. I also avoid treating the chin when it would look out of proportion with the rest of the face. When that happens, it is better to adjust the treatment plan rather than force a result that will not look natural.

The priority is always harmony and subtlety, not dramatic change.

<br />

## What to expect before, during and after treatment

### What happens before your appointment?

Your consultation takes place in your home where you are most comfortable. I evaluate your facial structure, movement patterns and goals. We discuss your concerns and I explain which treatment will create the most natural outcome. Avoiding blood thinners, alcohol and fish oil for a short period helps reduce bruising.

<br />

### What happens during your appointment?

Your treatment is precise and personalized. Chin Botox involves a few quick injections into the mentalis muscle. Chin filler is placed deep on the bone to create structure and support. I use topical numbing when appropriate and talk through each step so you know what to expect. Most patients describe the process as quick and very tolerable.

<br />

### What happens after your appointment?

You can return to your normal activities almost immediately. I recommend avoiding strenuous exercise for the rest of the day and keeping pressure off the area. Botox results appear gradually over the next week. Filler results are immediate, although mild swelling can occur for a short time.

Within a few days, the chin typically looks smooth, natural and well defined.

## Cost of chin Botox and chin filler

Chin Botox is priced by the unit. Chin filler is priced by the syringe. The total cost depends on the amount of product needed and the type of filler chosen. During consultation, I provide a clear and personalized plan so that you know exactly what to expect.

<br />

## Who is a good candidate?

You may benefit from chin Botox or chin filler if you notice:

- chin dimpling  
- an under projected or recessed chin  
- asymmetry  
- soft or uneven contour  
- early lower face aging  
- shadows or indentation in the chin  

I avoid treating the chin when it would compromise facial harmony. In those cases, a balanced plan creates a far more natural result.

## Frequently asked questions

### Chin filler

- **How much do chin fillers cost?**  
  Chin filler is priced by the syringe. At Caridi Concierge, dermal fillers start at 600 dollars per syringe. Most chin treatments use one syringe, sometimes two for more projection. You receive a clear treatment plan and pricing before we begin.

- **How painful is chin filler?**  
  Chin filler is very tolerable for most patients. I use topical numbing and the filler itself contains lidocaine. You may feel brief pressure or stinging with each injection, but it is usually quick and manageable.

- **How long do chin fillers last?**  
  Chin fillers typically last 9 to 18 months depending on the product used, your anatomy and how your body metabolizes hyaluronic acid.

- **How often should you have chin fillers?**  
  Many patients repeat chin filler every 12 to 18 months to maintain their result. Some prefer a small touch up sooner, others wait until most of the product has worn off. This is customized to your goals.

- **Will my chin go back to normal after fillers?**  
  Yes. Hyaluronic acid filler gradually breaks down over time. In addition, if needed, it can be dissolved sooner with an enzyme called hyaluronidase. Your underlying bone structure does not change.

- **What filler is used on the chin?**  
  For structure and support, I often use firmer hyaluronic acid fillers such as RHA 4 or Juvederm Voluma. For fine surface details, lighter products like Redensity or Restylane Refyne can be layered. The choice depends on your anatomy and goals.

- **What are the downsides of chin fillers?**  
  Most side effects are mild, such as swelling, bruising or tenderness for a few days. Less common risks include temporary asymmetry or a result that feels too full if too much product is used. Rare but serious complications, such as vascular occlusion, are why it is important to see an experienced medical provider who can recognize and treat issues quickly.

<br />

### Chin Botox

- **What does Botox on the chin do?**  
  Chin Botox relaxes the mentalis muscle. This softens dimpling, reduces an orange peel texture and helps the lower face look smoother and less tense.

- **When does chin Botox kick in and how long does it take to settle?**  
  You may notice early changes in three to five days. The full effect is usually visible by one to two weeks as the muscle relaxes and the skin smooths.

- **Can Botox change your chin shape or slim the chin?**  
  Chin Botox does not remove fat or change bone structure. It can subtly change how the chin looks by relaxing a tight or overactive muscle. For true slimming or contouring of the jawline, we usually look at other areas such as the masseter muscles or consider filler for better projection.

- **What are the side effects of Botox in the chin?**  
  Common side effects include mild redness, swelling or bruising at the injection sites. Less commonly, you may notice temporary changes in how the lower lip moves. Significant issues are rare when the treatment is performed by a trained medical professional.

- **Are there things I should avoid after chin Botox or filler?**  
  I recommend avoiding strenuous exercise, saunas and heavy pressure on the chin for the rest of the day after treatment. You should also avoid rubbing or massaging the area unless I specifically instruct you to do so.

- **How many units of Botox are used in the chin?**  
  Most patients benefit from 8 to 10 units for a consistent and natural looking result.

<br />

### Treatment planning and safety

- **Can Botox and filler be done on the same day?**  
  Yes. In many cases, treating both at the same visit creates the most seamless improvement.

- **Will chin filler look natural?**  
  When placed correctly and in the right amount, chin filler looks structural and refined rather than filled. My goal is always a balanced, undetectable result.

- **What is the difference between dimpling and structural issues?**  
  Dimpling comes from muscle activity. Structural issues come from bone shape or volume loss. Botox treats movement. Filler treats structure.

- **Can chin Botox go wrong?**  
  Complications are uncommon when performed by an experienced injector, but no procedure is risk free. The most important safety decision you make is choosing a qualified medical provider who understands anatomy and uses conservative, thoughtful dosing.

- **Can Botox and filler be done on the same day?**  
  Yes. In many cases, treating both at the same visit creates the most seamless improvement.

- **What is the difference between dimpling and structural issues?**  
  Dimpling comes from muscle activity. Structural issues come from bone shape or volume loss. Botox treats movement. Filler treats structure.
